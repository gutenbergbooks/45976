<h2>MY COUNTRY</h2>


<p>The Queen of a small Country!</p>

<p>Those who are accustomed to see rulers of greater
lands can little understand what it means.</p>

<p>It means work and anxiety and hope, and great toiling
for small results. But the field is large, and, if the heart
be willing, great is the work.</p>

<p>When young I thought it all work, uphill work; but
the passing years brought another knowledge, a blessed
knowledge, and now I know.</p>

<p>This is a small country, a new country, but it is a
country I love. I want others to love it also; therefore
listen to a few words about it. Let me paint a few
pictures, draw a few sketches as I have seen them, first
with my eyes, then with my heart.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>Once I was a stranger to this people; now I am one
of them, and, because I came from so far, better was I
able to see them with their good qualities and with their
defects.</p>

<p>Their country is a fruitful country, a country of vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
plains, of waving corn, of deep forests, of rocky mountains,
of rivers that in spring-time are turbulent with
foaming waters, that in summer are but sluggish streams
lost amongst stones. A country where peasants toil
'neath scorching suns, a country untouched by the squalor
of manufactories, a country of extremes where the winters
are icy and the summers burning hot.</p>

<p>A link between East and West.</p>

<p>At first it was an alien country, its roads too dusty,
too endless its plains. I had to learn to see its beauties&mdash;to
feel its needs with my heart.</p>

<p>Little by little the stranger became one of them, and
now she would like the country of her birth to see this
other country through the eyes of its Queen.</p>

<p>Yes, little by little I learnt to understand this people,
and little by little it learned to understand me.</p>

<p>Now we trust each other, and so, if God wills, together
we shall go towards a greater future!</p>

<p>My love of freedom and vast horizons, my love of
open air and unexplored paths led to many a discovery.
Alone I would ride for hours to reach a forlorn village,
to see a crumbling church standing amongst its rustic
crosses at a river's edge, or to be at a certain spot at
sunset when sky and earth would be drenched with flaming
red.</p>

<p>Oh! the Rumanian sunsets, how wondrous they
are!</p>

<p class="p1">Once I was riding slowly homewards.</p>

<p>The day had been torrid, the air was heavy with
dust. In oceans of burnished gold the corn-fields spread
before me. No breath of wind stirred their ripeness;
they seemed waiting for the hour of harvest, proud of
being the wealth of the land.</p>

<p>As far as my eye could reach, corn-fields, corn-fields,
dwindling away towards the horizon in a vapoury line.
A blue haze lay over the world, and with it a smell
of dew and ripening seed was slowly rising out of the
ground.</p>

<p>At the end of the road stood a well, its long pole like
a giant finger pointing eternally to the sky. Beside it
an old stone cross leaning on one side as though tired, a
cross erected with the well in remembrance of some one
who was dead....</p>

<p>Peace enveloped me&mdash;my horse made no movement,
it also was under the evening spell.</p>

<p>From afar a herd of buffaloes came slowly towards
me over the long straight road: an ungainly procession
of beasts that might have belonged to antediluvian times.</p>

<p>One by one they advanced&mdash;mud-covered, patient,
swinging their ugly bodies, carrying stiffly their heavily-horned
heads, their vacant eyes staring at nothing, though
here and there with raised faces they seemed to be seeking
something from the skies.</p>

<p>From under their hoofs rose clouds of dust accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
their every stride. The sinking sun caught hold
of it, turning it into fiery smoke. It was as a veil of light
spread over these beasts of burden, a glorious radiance
advancing with them towards their rest.</p>

<p>I stood quite still and looked upon them as they passed
me one by one.... And that evening a curtain seemed
to have been drawn away from many a mystery. I had
understood the meaning of the vast and fertile plain.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>Twenty-three years have I now spent in this country,
each day bringing its joy or its sorrow, its light or
its shade; with each year my interests widened, my
understanding deepened; I knew where I was needed
to help.</p>

<p>I am not going to talk of my country's institutions,
of its politics, of names known to the world. Others have
done this more cleverly than I ever could. I want only
to speak of its soul, of its atmosphere, of its peasants and
soldiers, of things that made me love this country, that
made my heart beat with its heart.</p>

<p>I have moved amongst the most humble. I have
entered their cottages, asked them questions, taken their
new-born in my arms.</p>

<p>I talked their language awkwardly, making many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mistake; but, although a stranger, nowhere amongst the
peasants did I meet with distrust or suspicion. They were
ready to converse with me, ready to let me enter their
cottages, and especially ready to speak of their woes. It
is always of their woes that the poor have to relate, but
these did it with singular dignity, speaking of death and
misery with stoic resignation, counting the graves of their
children as another would count the trees planted round
his house.</p>

<p>They are poor, they are ignorant, these peasants.
They are neglected and superstitious, but there is a grand
nobility in their race. They are frugal and sober, their
wants are few, their desires limited; but one great dream
each man cherishes in the depth of his heart: he wishes
to be a landowner, to possess the ground that he tills;
he wishes to call it his own. This they one and all told
me; it was the monotonous refrain of all their talk.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>When first I saw a Rumanian village, with its tiny
huts hidden amongst trees, the only green spots on the
immense plains, I could hardly believe that families could
inhabit houses so small.</p>

<p>They resembled the houses we used to draw as children,
with a door in the middle, a tiny window on each side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and smoke curling somewhere out of the heavily thatched
roof. Often these roofs seem too heavy for the cottages;
they seem to crush them, and the wide-open doors make
them look as if they were screaming for help.</p>

<p>In the evening the women sit with their distaffs spinning
on the doorsteps, whilst the herds come tramping home
through the dust, and the dogs bark furiously, filling the
air with their clamour.</p>

<p>Nowhere have I seen so many dogs as in a Rumanian
village&mdash;a sore trial to the rider on a frisky horse.</p>

<p>All night long the dogs bark, answering each other.
They are never still; it is a sound inseparable from the
Rumanian night.</p>

<p>I always loved to wander through these villages. I
have done so at each season, and every month has its
charm.</p>

<p>In spring-time they are half-buried in fruit-trees, a
foamy ocean of blossoms out of which the round roofs of
the huts rise like large grey clouds.</p>

<p>Chickens, geese, and newly born pigs sport hither and
thither over the doorsteps; early hyacinths and golden
daffodils run loose in the untidy courtyards, where strangely
shaped pots and bright rags of carpets lie about in
picturesque disorder.</p>

<p>Amongst all this the half-naked black-eyed children
crawl about in happy freedom.</p>

<p><span class="vh"><a name="ill010a" id="ill010a">10A</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">"IT IS ESPECIALLY IN THE DOBRUDJA THAT THESE DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES
JOSTLE TOGETHER" <span class="pca">(p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>).</span></p>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Never was I able to understand how such large families,
without counting fowls and many a four-footed friend,
could find room in the two minute chambers of which
these huts are composed.</p>

<p>In winter these villages are covered with snow; each
hut is a white padded heap; all corners are rounded off
so that every cottage has the aspect of being packed in
cotton-wool.</p>

<p>No efforts are made to clear away the drifts. The
snow lies there where it has fallen; the small sledges bump
over its inequalities, forming roads as wavy as a storm-beaten
sea!</p>

<p>The Rumanian peasant is never in a hurry. Time
plays no part in his scheme of life. Accustomed to limitless
horizons, he does not expect to reach the end of his
way in a day.</p>

<p>In summer the carts, in winter the sledges, move along
those endless roads, slowly, resignedly, with untiring
patience.</p>

<p>Drawn by tiny, lean horses, the wooden sledges bump
over the uneven snow, the peasant sits half-hidden amongst
his stacks of wood, hay, or maize-stalks, according to
the freight he may be transporting from place to place.
Picturesque in his rough sheep-skin coat, he is just as
picturesque in summer in his white shirt and broad felt
hat, contentedly lying upon his stacked-up corn, whilst
his long-suffering oxen trudge away, seemingly as
indifferent as their master to the length of the road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
They are stone-grey, these oxen-lean, strong, with
large-spread horns; their eyes are beautiful, with almost
human look.</p>

<p>The Rumanian road is a characteristic feature of the
country. It is wide, it is dusty, generally it is straight,
few trees shading its borders; mostly it is badly kept.
But, like all things upon which civilisation has not yet laid
too heavy a hand, it has an indefinite charm&mdash;the charm
of immensity, something dreamy, something infinite, something
that need never come to an end....</p>

<p>And along these roads the peasants' carts crawl, one
after another in an endless file, enveloped in clouds of
dust. If night overtake them on the way the oxen are
unyoked, the carts are drawn up beside the ditch, till
the rising dawn reminds them that there are still many
miles to their goal....</p>

<p>When it rains the dust turns to mud; the road becomes
then a river of mud!</p>

<p>Rumania is not a country of violent colours. There
is a curious unity in its large horizons, its dusty roads,
its white-clad peasants, its rough wooden carts. Even
oxen and horses seem to have toned down to grey or dun,
so as to become one with a sort of dreamy haziness that
lies over the whole.</p>

<p>It is only the sunsets that turn all these shadowy tints
into a sudden marvel of colour, flooding earth and sky
with wondrous gold. I have seen hay-stacks change into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
fiery pyramids, rivers into burning ribbons, and pale,
tired faces light up with a marvellous glow.</p>

<p>A fleeting hour this hour of sunset, but each time it
bursts upon me as an eternally renewed promise sent by
God above.</p>

<p>Perchance 'tis in winter and autumn that these sunsets
are most glorious, when the earth is tired, when its
year's labour is done, or when it is sleeping 'neath its
shimmering shroud of snow, guarding in its bosom the
harvest that is to come.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>Very different are the mountain villages from those of
the plain. The cottages are less miserable, less small, the
thatched roofs are replaced by roofs of shingle that shine
like silver in the sun. Richer and more varied are the
peasants' costumes; the colours are brighter, and often a
tiny flower-filled garden surrounds the house.</p>

<p>Autumn is the season to visit these villages amongst
the hills; autumn, when the trees are a flaming glory,
when the dying year sends out a last effort of beauty before
being vanquished by frost and snow.</p>

<p>Many a hearty welcome has been given me in these
little villages, the peasants receiving me with flower-filled
hands. At the first sign of my carriage, troops of rustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
riders gallop out to meet me, scampering helter-skelter on
their shaggy little horses, bearing banners or flowering
branches, shouting with delight. Full tilt they fly after
my carriage, raising clouds of dust. Like their masters,
the ponies are wild with excitement; all is noise, colour,
movement; joy runs wild over the earth.</p>

<p>The bells of the village ring, their voices are full of
gladness, they too cry out their welcome. Crowds of
gaily clad women and children flock out of the houses,
having plundered their gardens so as to strew flowers
before the feet of their Queen.</p>

<p>The church generally stands in the middle of the
village; here the sovereign must leave her carriage, and,
surrounded by an eager, happy crowd, she is led towards
the sanctuary, where the priest receives her at the door,
cross in hand.</p>

<p>Wherever she moves the crowd moves with her; there
is no awkwardness, no shyness, but neither is there any
pushing or crushing. The Rumanian peasants remain
dignified; they are seldom rowdy in their joy. They
want to look at one, to touch one, to hear one's voice;
but they show no astonishment and little curiosity.
Mostly their expression remains serious, and their children
stare at one with grave faces and huge, impressive
eyes.</p>

<p>It is only the galloping riders who become loud in
their joy.</p>

<p class="p1">There are some strange customs amongst the peasants,
curious superstitions. Rumania being a dry country, it
is lucky to arrive with rain: it means abundance, fertility,
the hope of a fine harvest&mdash;wealth.</p>

<p>Sometimes as I went through the villages, the peasant
women would put large wooden buckets full of water before
their threshold; a full vessel is a sign of Good-luck.
They will even sprinkle water before one's feet, always
because of that strange superstition, that water is abundance,
and, when the great one comes amongst them, honour
must be done unto her in every way.</p>

<p>I have seen tall, handsome girls step out of their houses
to meet me with overflowing water-jars on their heads;
on my approach they stood quite still, the drops splashing
over their faces so as well to prove that their pitchers
were full.</p>

<p>It is lucky to meet a cart full of corn or straw coming
towards one; but an empty cart is a sure sign of Ill-luck!</p>

<p>Many a time, in places I came to, the inhabitants have
crowded around me, kissing my hands, the hem of my
dress, falling down to kiss my feet, and more than once
have they brought me their children, who made the Sign of
the Cross before me as though I had been the holy Image
in a church.</p>

<p>At first it was difficult unblushingly to accept such
homage, but little by little I got accustomed to these loyal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
manifestations; half humble, half proud, I would advance
amongst them, happy to be in their midst.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>It were impossible to describe all I have seen, heard,
or felt whilst moving amongst these simple, warm-hearted
people; so many vivid pictures, so many touching scenes
have remained imprinted on my heart. I have wandered
through villages lost in forsaken spots, upon burning
plains; I have climbed up to humble little houses clustering
together on mountain-sides. I have come upon lovely
little places hidden amongst giant pines. On forlorn seashores
I have discovered humble hamlets where Turks
dwelt in solitary aloofness; near the broad Danube I
have strayed amongst tiny boroughs inhabited by Russian
fisher-folk, whose type is so different from that of the
Rumanian peasant. At first sight one recognises their
nationality&mdash;tall, fair-bearded giants, with blue eyes,
their red shirts visible from a great way off.</p>

<p>It is especially in the Dobrudja that these different
nationalities jostle together: besides Rumanians, Bulgarians,
Turks, Tartars, Russians, in places even Germans,
live peacefully side by side.</p>

<p>I have been to a village in the Dobrudja which was
part Rumanian, part Russian, part German, part Turkish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
I went from one side to another, visiting many a cottage,
entering each church, ending my round in the tiny rustic
mosque hung with faded carpets, and there amongst a
crowd of lowly Turks I listened to their curious service, of
which I understood naught. A woman who is not veiled
has no right to enter the holy precinct; but a royal name
opens many a door, and many a severe rule is broken in the
joy of receiving so unusual a guest.</p>

<p>On a burning summer's day I came to a tiny town almost
entirely inhabited by Turks. I was distributing money
amongst the poor and forsaken, and had been moving from
place to place. Now it was the turn of the Mussulman
population, therefore did I visit the most wretched quarters,
my hands filled with many a coin.</p>

<p>Such was their joy at my coming that the real object
of my visit was almost forgotten. I found myself surrounded
by a swarm of excited women in strange attire,
prattling a language I could not understand.</p>

<p>They called me Sultana, and each one wanted to touch
me; they fingered my clothes, patted me on the back,
one old hag even chucked me under the chin. They drew
me with them from hut to hut, from court to court. I
found myself separated from my companions, wandering
in a world I had never known. Amongst a labyrinth
of tiny mud-built huts, of ridiculously small gardens, of
hidden little courts, did they drag me with them, making
me enter their hovels, put my hand on their children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sit down on their stools. Like a swarm of crows they
jabbered and fought over me, asking me questions,
overwhelming me with kind wishes, to all of which I
could answer but with a shrug of the shoulders and
with smiles.</p>

<p>The poorer Mussulman women are not really veiled.
They wear wide cotton trousers, and over these a sort of
mantle which they hold together under the nose. The
shape of these mantles gives them that indescribable line,
so agreeable to the eye, and which alone belongs to the
East. Also the colours they choose are always harmonious;
besides, they are toned down to their surroundings by
sun and dust. They wear strange dull blues and mauves&mdash;even
their blacks are not really black, but have taken
rusty tints that mingle pleasingly with the mud-coloured
environment in which they dwell.</p>

<p>When attired for longer excursions, their garb is generally
black, with a snow-white cloth on their heads, wrapped
in such manner that it conceals the entire face, except
the eyes.</p>

<p>Indescribably picturesque and mysterious are these
dusky figures when they come towards one, grazing the
walls, generally carrying a heavy staff in their hands;
there is something biblical about them, something that
takes one back to far-away times!</p>

<p>On this hot summer's morn of which I am relating, I
managed to escape for a moment from my over-amiable
assailants, so as to steal into a tiny hut of which the door
stood wide open.</p>

<p><span class="vh"><a name="ill018a" id="ill018a">18A</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Irresistibly attracted by its mysterious shade, I penetrated
into the mud-made hovel, finding myself in almost
complete darkness. At the farther end a wee window let
in a small ray of light.</p>

<p>Groping my way, I came upon a pallet of rags, and
upon that couch of misery I discovered an old, old woman&mdash;so
old, so old, that she might have existed in the time of
fairies and witches, times no more in touch with the bustle
and noise of to-day.</p>

<p>Bending over her, I gazed into her shrunken face, and
all the legends of my youth seemed to rise up before me,
all the stories that as a child, entranced, I had listened
to, stories one never forgets....</p>

<p>Above her, hanging from a rusty nail within reach
of her hand, was a curiously shaped black earthenware
pot. Everything around this old hag was the colour of
the earth: her face, her dwelling, the rags that covered
her, the floor on which I stood. The only touch of light
in this hovel was a white lamb, crouching quite undisturbed
at the foot of her bed.</p>

<p>Pressing some money between her crooked bony fingers,
I left this strange old mortal to her snowy companion,
and, stepping back into the sunshine, I had the sensation
that for an instant it had been given me to stray through
unnumbered ages into the days of yore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning of time Rumania was a land
subjected to invasions. One tyrannical master after another
laid heavy hands upon its people; it was accustomed
to be dominated, crushed, maltreated. Seldom was it
allowed to affirm itself, to raise its head, to be independent,
happy, or free; nevertheless, in spite of struggles and
slavery, it was not a people destined to disappear. It
overcame every hardship, stood every misery, endured
every subjugation, could not be crushed out of being;
but the result is that the Rumanian folk are not gay.</p>

<p>Their songs are sad, their dances slow, their amusements
are seldom boisterous, rarely are their voices loud.
On festive days they don their gayest apparel and, crowded
together in the dust of the road, they will dance in groups
or in wide circles, tirelessly, for many an hour; but even
then they are not often joyful or loud, they are solemn
and dignified, seeming to take their amusement demurely,
without passion, without haste.</p>

<p>Their love-songs are long complaints; the tunes they
play on their flutes wail out endlessly their longing and
desire that appear to remain eternally unsatisfied, to
contain no hope, no fulfilment.</p>

<p>For the same reason few very old houses exist; there
is hardly a castle or a great monument remaining from
out the past. What was the use of building fine habitations
if any day the enemy might sweep over the country
and burn everything to the ground?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>One or two strange old constructions have been preserved
from those times of invasion: square, high buildings
with an open gallery round the top formed by stout short
columns, and here and there, in the immense thickness
of the walls, tiny windows as look-outs. Primitive strongholds,
half tower, half peasant-house, they generally stand
somewhat isolated and resemble nothing I have seen in
other lands.</p>

<p>I have lived in one of these strange houses. The
gallery, that once was a buttress, had been turned into a
balcony, and from between the squat pillars a lovely
view was to be had over hill and plain. The rooms
beneath were small, low, irregular, behind great thick
walls; a wooded staircase as steep as a ladder led to
these chambers.</p>

<p>Both outside and inside the building was whitewashed,
and so primitive was its construction, that it had kept
the delightful appearance of having been modelled by a
potter's thumb. There were no sharp angles, but something
rounded and uneven about its corners that no modern
dwelling can possess. The whole was crowned by a broad
roof of shingle, grey, with silver lights.</p>

<p>But it is the old convents and monasteries of this
country that have above all guarded treasure from out
the past.</p>

<p>From the very first these secluded spots of beauty
attracted me more than anything else; indescribable is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the spell that they throw over me, almost inexplicable the
delight with which they fill my soul!</p>

<p>As in many other countries, the Rumanian monks and
nuns knew how to select the most enchanting places for
their homes of peace.</p>

<p>I have wandered from one to another, discovering
many a hidden treasure, visiting the richest and the poorest,
those easy of access and those hidden away in mountain
valleys, where the traveller's foot but rarely strays.</p>

<p>Some I was only able to reach on horseback, having
climbed over hill and dale, up or down stony passes,
followed by troops of white-clad peasants, mounted on
shaggy, dishevelled ponies, sure-footed as mountain-goats.</p>

<p>Once at dusk, after a whole day's riding over the
mountains, I came quite suddenly upon one of these far-away
sanctuaries, whitewashed, strangely picturesque,
half-hidden amongst pines and venerable beech-trees with
trunks like giants turned suddenly to stone&mdash;giants that
in their last agony are twisting their arms in useless
despair.</p>

<p>On my approach the bells began ringing&mdash;their clear
and strident voices proclaiming their joy to the skies.</p>

<p>I rode through the covered portal into the walled-in
court. Before I could dismount I was surrounded by a
dark swarm of nuns making humble gestures of greeting,
crossing themselves, falling to their knees, and pressing
their foreheads against the stones on the ground, catching
hold of my hands or part of my garment, which they
kissed, whilst they cried and murmured, mumbling many
a prayer.</p>

<p class="p1">Dazed by such a welcome, I was seized under the elbow
by the mother abbess, a venerable, tottering old woman,
whose face was seared by age as a field is furrowed by the
plough.</p>

<p>Half leading me, half hanging on to me for support,
she conducted me towards the open church-door. From
time to time she would furtively kiss my shoulder, and
in a sort of lowly ecstasy press her old, old face close to
mine.</p>

<p>All the other nuns trooped after us like a flock of black-plumed
birds, their dark veils waving about in the wind,
the bells still ringing in peals of delight!</p>

<p>Within the dim sanctuary the lighted tapers were as
swarms of fire-flies in a dusk-filled forest; the nuns grouped
themselves along the walls, their dark dresses becoming
one with the shadow, so that alone their faces stood out,
rendered almost ethereal by the wavering candle-light.</p>

<p>They were chanting&mdash;fain would I say that their singing
was beautiful, but that were scarcely the truth! Not as
in Russia, the chanting in the Rumanian churches is
far from melodious&mdash;they drone through the nose longdrawn,
oft-repeated chants, anything but harmonious, and
which seemingly have no reason ever to come to an end.</p>

<p>But somehow, that evening, in the forlorn mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
convent far from the homes of men, there, in the low-domed
chapel, filled with those sable-clad figures whose
earnest faces were almost angelic in the mystical light, the
weird sounds that rose towards the roof were not out of
place. There was something old-time about them, something
archaic, primitive, in keeping with the somewhat
barbaric paintings and images, something that seemed
to have strayed down from past ages into the busier world
of to-day....</p>

<p>More pompous were the receptions I received in the
larger monasteries.</p>

<p>Here all the monks would file out to meet me&mdash;a
procession of black-robed, long-bearded beings, austere of
appearance, sombre of face.</p>

<p>Taking me by the arm, the Father Superior would
solemnly lead me towards the gaily decorated church,
whilst many little children would throw flowers before
me as I passed.</p>

<p>Not over-severe are the monastic rules in Rumania.
The convent-doors are open to all visitors; in former days
they were houses of rest for travellers wandering from
place to place.</p>

<p>Three days' hospitality did the holy walls offer to
those passing that way; this was the ancient custom, and
now in many places monks or nuns are allowed to let their
little houses to those in need of a summer's rest. This,
however, is only possible where the convents are real little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
villages, where more or less each recluse possesses his own
small house.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of convents in this country: either
a large building where all the monks or nuns are united
beneath the same roof, or a quantity of tiny houses grouped
in a large square round the central church.</p>

<p>The former alone are architecturally interesting, and
some I have visited are exquisitely perfect in proportion
and shape.</p>

<p>One of these convents above all others draws me
towards it, for irresistible indeed is its charm.</p>

<p>A convent ... white and lonely, hidden away in wooded
regions greener and sweeter than any other in the land.
Perfect is the form of its church, snow-white the colonnades
that surround its tranquil court. A charm and a
mystery envelop it, such as nowhere else have I felt.
Sober are its sculptures, but an indescribable harmony
makes its lines beautiful, and such a peace pervades the
place that here I felt as though I had truly found the
house of rest....</p>

<p>Whenever I go there the nuns receive me with touching
delight, half astonished that one so high should care
about so simple a place. I go there often, whenever I
can, for it has thrown a strange spell over me, and often
again must I return to its whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>The building forms a quadrangle round the church,
three sides of which are composed of a double colonnade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
built one above the other, the upper one forming an open
gallery running round the whole. Behind these colonnades
are the nuns' small cells: tiny domes, little chambers,
whitewashed, humble, and still....</p>

<p>Large is the church, noble of line, rich of sculpture,
fronted by a large, covered porch supported by stone
pillars richly carved. Like the interior of the building,
this porch is decorated all over with frescoes, artless of
conception, archaic of design, and harmonious, the colour
having been toned down by the hand of time.</p>

<p>Within, the church is high, dim, mystical, entirely
painted with strange-faced saints, who stare at one as
though astonished to be disturbed out of their lonely
silence and peace.</p>

<p>Many a treasure lies within these walls: ancient images,
crumbling tombstones, a marvellously carved altar-screen,
gilt and painted with incomparable skill, all the colours
faded and blended together by the master of all arts&mdash;Time.</p>

<p>In shadowy corners, heavily chased lamps, hanging
on chains from above, shed a mysterious light upon silver-framed
icons, polished by many a pious kiss. In truth a
holy sanctuary, inducing the spirit to soar above the things
of this earth....</p>

<p><span class="vh"><a name="ill026a" id="ill026a">26A</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The fourth side of the quadrangle is shut in by a high
wall, with a door in the centre opening upon a narrow
path that leads towards a second smaller temple, as perfect
in shape as the greater building of the inner court. Here
the nuns are buried; an idyllic spot enclosed by crumbling
walls that wild rose-bushes, covered with delicate blooms,
hold together by their long thorny arms. The strangely
shaped wooden crosses that mark the graves stand amidst
high, waving grass and venerable apple-trees that age
seems to incline tenderly towards those slumbering beneath
the sod at their feet.</p>

<p>All round&mdash;beech forests upon low, undulating hills; as
background to these, mountains&mdash;blue, hazy, unreachable,
forming a barrier against the outside world....</p>

<p>A place of beauty, a place of rest, a place of peace....</p>

<p>Many sites of beauty rise before my eyes when I think
of these hidden houses of prayer. Countless is the number
I have visited in all four corners of the land, and again
I turn my feet towards them whenever I can.</p>

<p>Hard were it to say which are the more picturesque,
the convents or the monasteries; both are equally interesting,
equally quaint.</p>

<p>I remember a small monastery, nestling beneath the
sides of a frowning mountain, surrounded by pine forests,
dark and mysterious. The way leading there was tortuous,
stony, difficult of access, yet the place itself was a small
meadow-encircled paradise of tranquillity, green and reposeful
as a dream of rest.</p>

<p>Strange old monks inhabited it&mdash;silent recluses, buried
away from the world, shadowy spectres, almost sinister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in their aloofness, their eyes having taken the look of
forest-dwellers who are no more accustomed to look into
the eyes of men.</p>

<p>Noiselessly they followed me wherever I went, heads
bent, but their eyes watching me from beneath shaggy
brows, their hands concealed within their wide hanging
sleeves; it was as though dark shadows were dogging my
every step.</p>

<p>I turned round and looked into their obscure faces&mdash;how
far-away they seemed! Who were they? What
was their story? what had been their childhood, their
hopes, their loves? For the most part, I think, they
were but humble, ignorant beings, with no wider ideals,
no far-away visions of higher things. Some were so old,
so bent that they could no more raise their heads to look
up at the sky above; their long, grey beards had taken
on the appearance of lichens growing upon fallen trees.</p>

<p>But one there was amongst them, tall and upright,
with the pale, ascetic face of a saint. I know not his name,
naught of his past; but he had a noble visage, and meseemed
that in his eyes I could read dreams that were not only
the dreams of this earth.</p>

<p>I cannot, alas! speak of all the convents I have seen,
but one I must still mention, for indeed it is a rare little
spot upon earth.</p>

<p>Hidden within the mouth of a cavern, lost in the wildest
mountain region, there lies a tiny wee church, so small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
so small that one must bend one's head to step over the
threshold; it appears to be a toy, dropped there by some
giant hand and forgotten. Only a tiny little wooden
chapel guarded by a few hoary old monks, creatures so
old and decrepit that they seem to have gathered moss
like stones lying for ever in the same place....</p>

<p>No road leads to this sanctuary; one must seek one's
way to it on foot or horseback, over mountain steeps and
precipitous rocks. There it lies in the dark cave entry,
solitary, grey, and ancient, like a hidden secret waiting
to be found out.</p>

<p>Behind the wee church the hollow stretches, dark and
tortuous, running in mysterious obscurity right into the
heart of the earth. When the end is reached a gurgling
of water is heard&mdash;a spring, ice-cold, bubbles there out of
the earth, pure and fresh as the sources in the Garden
of Eden....</p>

<p>I have known of passionate lovers coming to be married
in this church, defying the hardships of the road, defying
nature's frowning barriers, so as to be bound together
for life in this far-away spot where crowds cannot gather.</p>

<p>On the way to this church, not far from the mouth of
the cave, stands a lonely little cemetery, filled with crosses
of wood. Here the monks who have lived out their solitary
lives are finally laid to eternal rest. Dark are those
crosses, standing like spectres against the naked rock.
The summer suns scorch them, the winds of autumn beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
them about, and ofttimes the snows of winter fell them
to the ground. But in spring-time early crocuses
and delicate anemones cluster around them, gathering in
fragrant bunches about their feet.</p>

<p>Meseems that, in spite of its solitude, it would not be
sad to be buried in such a spot....</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>Once I was riding through the melting snow. The road
I was following, like all Rumanian roads, was long, long,
endlessly long, dwindling away in the distance, becoming
one with the colourless sky.</p>

<p>It was a day of depression, a day of thaw, when the
world is at its worst.</p>

<p>All around me the flat plains lay waiting for something
that did not come. The landscape appeared to be without
horizon, to possess no frontiers: all was dully uniform,
without life, without light, without joy. Silence lay over
the earth&mdash;silence and dismal repose.</p>

<p>With loose reins and hanging heads my horse and I
trudged along through the slush. We were going nowhere
in particular; a sort of torpor of indifference had come
over us, well in keeping with the melancholy of the day.</p>

<p>A damp fog hung like a faded veil close over the earth;
it was not a dense fog, but wavered about like steam.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="p1">All of a sudden, I heard a weird sound coming towards
me out of the distance, something the like of which I
had never heard before....</p>

<p>Drawing in my reins, I stood still at the edge of the
road wondering what I was to see.</p>

<p>Unexpected indeed was the procession that, like a
strange dream, was coming towards me from out the
mist!</p>

<p>Wading through the melting snow advanced two small
boys, carrying between them a round tin platter on which
lay a flat cake; behind them came an old priest carrying
a cross in his hand, gaudily attired in faded finery&mdash;red,
gold and blue. His heavy vestment was all splashed and
soiled, his long hair and unkempt beard were dirty-grey,
like the road upon which he walked. A sad old man, with
no expression but that of misery upon his yellow shrunken
face.</p>

<p>Close behind his heels followed a rough wooden cart
drawn by oxen whose noses almost touched the ground;
their breath formed small clouds about their heads, through
which their eyes shone with patient anxiety.</p>

<p>It was from this cart that the weird sound was rising.
What could it be? Then all at once I understood!</p>

<p>A plain deal coffin had been placed in the middle of
the cart; seated around it were a number of old women,
wailing and weeping, raising their voices in a dismal chant,
that rang like a lament through the air. Their white hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was dishevelled, and their black veils floated around them
like thin wisps of smoke.</p>

<p>Behind the cart walked four old gipsies playing doleful
tunes upon their squeaky violins, whilst the women's
voices took up the refrain in another key. Never had I
heard dirge more mournful, nor more lugubrious a noise.
Pressing after the gipsies came a knot of barefooted relatives,
holding lighted tapers in their hands. The tiny
flames looked almost ashamed of burning so dimly in the
melancholy daylight.</p>

<p>In passing, these weary mortals raised pale faces,
looking at me with mournful eyes that expressed no
astonishment. Through the gloomy mist they appeared
to be so many ghosts, come from nowhere, going towards
I know not what. Like shadows they passed and were
gone; ... but through the gathering fog the wailing came
back to haunt me, curiously persistent, as though the
dead from his narrow coffin were calling for help....</p>

<p>Long after this strange vision had disappeared, I
stood gazing at the road where traces of their feet had
remained imprinted upon the melted snow. Had it all
been but an hallucination, created by the melancholy of
the day?</p>

<p>As I turned my horse I was confronted by a shadow
looming large at a little distance down the road. What
could it be? Was this a day of weird apparitions?</p>

<p>It was not without difficulty that I induced my horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to approach the spot; verily, I think that sometimes
horses see ghosts!...</p>

<p>On nearing, I perceived that what had frightened
my mount was naught but a tall stone cross. Monumental,
moss-grown, and mysterious, it stood all alone
like a guardian keeping eternal watch over the road. From
its outstretched arms great drops were falling to the ground
like heavy tears....</p>

<p>Was the old cross weeping&mdash;weeping because a lovely
funeral had passed that way?...</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>I must talk a little about these strange old crosses that
on all roads I have come upon, that I have met with in
every part of the country.</p>

<p>As yet I have not quite fathomed their meaning&mdash;but
I love them, they seem so well in keeping with the somewhat
melancholy character of the land.</p>

<p>Generally they stand by the wayside, sometimes in
stately solitude, sometimes in groups; sometimes they
are of quaintly carved stone, sometimes they are of wood,
crudely painted with figures of archaic saints.</p>

<p>No doubt these pious monuments have been raised to
mark the places of some event; perhaps the death of
some hero, or only the murder of a lonely traveller who
was not destined to reach the end of his road....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Mostly they stand beside wells, bearing the names
of those who, having thought of the thirsty, erected these
watering-places in far-away spots.</p>

<p>Quaint of shape, they attract the eye from far; the
peasant uncovers his head before them, murmuring a
prayer for the dead.</p>

<p>At cross-roads I have sometimes come upon them
ten in a row; when found in such numbers they are mostly
hewn out of wood. Their forms and sizes are varied:
some are immensely high and solid, covered by queer
shingle roofs; often their design is intricate, several crosses,
growing one out of another, forming a curious pattern,
the whole painted in the crudest colours that sun and
rain soon tone down to pleasant harmony.</p>

<p>Protected by their greater companions, many little
crosses crowd alongside: round crosses and square crosses,
crosses that are slim and upright, crosses that seem humbly
to bend towards the ground....</p>

<p>On lonely roads these rustic testimonies of Faith are
curiously fascinating. One wonders what vows were made
when they were placed there by pious hands and believing
hearts.</p>

<p>But, above all, the carved crosses of stone attract me.
I have discovered them in all sorts of places; some are
of rare beauty, covered with inscriptions entangled in
wonderful designs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I have come upon them on bare fields, on the edges
of dusty roads, on the borders of dark forests, on lonely
mountain-sides. I have found them on forsaken waters
by the sea, where the gulls circled around them caressing
them gently with the tips of their wings.</p>

<p>Many a mile have I ridden so as to have another look
at these mysterious symbols, for always anew they fill
my soul with an intense desire for tranquillity; they are
so solemnly impressive, so silent, so still....</p>

<p>One especially was dear to my heart. It stood all
alone in dignified solitude upon a barren field, frowning
down upon a tangle of thistles that twisted their thorny
stems beneath the shade of its arms.</p>

<p>I know not its history, nor why it was watching over
so lonely a place; it appeared to have been there from
the beginning of time. Tired of its useless vigil, it was
leaning slightly on one side, and at dusk its shadow strangely
resembled the shadow of a man.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>Nothing is more touchingly picturesque than the village
cemeteries: the humbler they are the more do they delight
the artist's eye.</p>

<p>Often they are placed round the village church, but
sometimes they lie quite apart. I always seek them out,
loving to wander through their poetical desolation&mdash;feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
so far, so far from the noise and haste of our
turbulent world.</p>

<p>Certainly these little burial-grounds are not tended
and cared for as in tidier lands. The graves are scattered
about amidst weeds and nettles, sometimes thistles grow
so thickly about the crosses that they half hide them
from sight. But in spring-time, before the grass is high,
I have found some of them nearly buried in daffodils and
irises running riot all over the place. The shadowy crosses
look down upon all that wealth of colour as though wondering
if God Himself had adorned their forsaken graves.</p>

<p>The Rumanian peasant is averse from any unnecessary
effort. What must happen happens, what must fall falls.
Therefore, if a cross is broken, why try to set it up again?&mdash;let
it lie! the grass will cover it, the flowers will cluster
in its place.</p>

<p>On Good Friday morning I was roaming through one
of these village churchyards. To my astonishment I
found that nearly every grave was lighted with a tiny
thin taper, the flame of which burnt palely, incapable of
vying with the light of the sun. Lying beside these ghostly
little lights were broken fragments of pottery filled with
smouldering ashes, that sent thin spirals of blue smoke
into the tranquil spring air. On this day of mourning the
living come to do honour to their dead according to their
customs, according to their Faith.</p>

<p>A strange sight indeed! all those wavering little flames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
amongst the crumbling graves. Often did I find a candle
standing on a spot where all vestige of the grave itself
had been entirely effaced; but it stood there burning
bravely&mdash;some one remembering that just beneath that
very inch of ground a heart had been laid to rest.</p>

<p>An old woman I found that morning standing quite
still beside one of those tapers&mdash;a taper so humble and
thin that it could scarcely remain upright&mdash;but with crossed
arms the old mother was watching it, as though silently
accomplishing some rite.</p>

<p>Approaching her, I looked to see of what size was the
grave she was guarding, but could perceive no grave at all!
The yellow little taper was humbly standing beside a
bunch of anemones. All that once had been a tomb had
long since been trodden into the ground.</p>

<p>The cloth round the old woman's head was white,
white as the blossoming cherry-trees that made gay this
little garden of God; white were also the flowers that
grew beside the old woman's offering of love.</p>

<p>"Who is buried there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"One of my own," was her answer. "She was my
daughter's little daughter; now she is at rest."</p>

<p>"Why is the grave no more to be seen?" was my
next inquiry.</p>

<p>For all answer a shrug of the shoulders, and the dim
eyes looked into mine; complete resignation was what I
read in their depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the use of keeping a grave tidy if the priest
of the village allows his oxen to graze about amidst the
tombs?"</p>

<p>I looked at her in astonishment. "Could not such
disorder be put a stop to?"</p>

<p>Again a shrug of the shoulders. "Who is there
to put a stop to it? The cattle must have somewhere
to feed!"</p>

<p>I saw that she considered it quite natural, and that
which lay beneath the ground could verily be indifferent
to those passing hoofs, as long as on Good Friday some
one remembered to burn a taper over her heart!</p>

<p>On Good Friday night, long services are celebrated in
every church or chapel in the land.</p>

<p>Full of mystical charm are those peasant gatherings
round their humble houses of prayer. Men, women, and
children flock together, each one bearing a light. Those
who find no place within stand outside in patient crowds.</p>

<p>A lovely picture indeed.</p>

<p>From each church window the light streams forth,
whilst weird chants float out to those waiting beyond.
In front of the sanctuary hundreds of wavering little
flames, lighting up the visages of those who, with ecstatic
faces, are hearkening for sounds of the service that is being
celebrated within.</p>

<p>Custom will have it that, on Good Friday nights, flowers
shall be brought by the worshippers&mdash;flowers that are
reverently laid upon an embroidered effigy of the crucified
Christ which is placed on a table in the centre of the
church.</p>

<p class="p1">Each believer brings what he can: a scrap of green,
a branch of blossoms, a handful of hyacinths, making
the night sweet with their perfume, or a bunch of simple
violets gathered along the wayside&mdash;first dear messengers
of spring.</p>

<p>When the service is over, in long processions the worshippers
return to their homes, one and all carefully
shading the tapers, for it is lucky to bring them lighted
back to the house.</p>

<p>No more light shines now from the church windows;
all is swathed in darkness; the church itself stands out
a huge mass of shade against the sky.</p>

<p>But the graveyard beyond is a garden of light! Have
all the stars fallen from the heavens to console those lying
beneath the sod? or is it only the tiny tapers still bravely
burning, burning for the dead?...</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>There are some wonderful old churches in the country,
stately buildings, rich and venerable, full of treasures
carefully preserved from out the past.</p>

<p>I have visited all these churches, inquiring into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
history, admiring their perfect proportions, closely examining
their costly embroideries, their carvings, their silver
lamps, their enamelled crosses, their Bibles bound in
gold.</p>

<p>But, in spite of their beauty, none of the greater buildings
attract me so strongly as those little village churches
I have hunted up in the far-away corners of the land.</p>

<p>One part of the country is especially rich in these quaint
little buildings: it is a part I dearly love. No railway
desecrates its tranquil valleys, no modern improvement
has destroyed its simple charm. Here the hand of civilisation
has marred no original beauty; no well-meaning
painter has touched up the faded frescoes on ancient walls.
A corner of the earth that has preserved its personality;
being difficult to reach, it has remained unchanged,
unspoilt.</p>

<p>The axe has not felled its glorious forests, the enterprising
speculator has built no hideous hotels, no places
of entertainment; no monstrous advertisements disfigure
its green meadows, its fertile inclines.</p>

<p>Therefore, also, have the tiniest little churches been
preserved. They lie scattered about in quite unlikely
places; perched on steep hill-tops, hidden in wooded valleys,
often reflecting their quaint silhouettes in rivers flowing
at their base.</p>

<p>Seen from afar, tall fir-trees, planted like sentinels before
their porches, are the sign-posts marking the sites where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
they stand. The churches behind are so diminutive that
from a distance the trees alone are to be seen.</p>

<p>These fir-trees seemed to beckon to me, promising
that I should find treasures hidden at their feet&mdash;they
stand out darkly distinct in the landscape, for it is a region
where the forests are of beeches, not of pines.</p>

<p>Often I wandered miles to reach them, over stony
paths, over muddy ground, through turbulent little streams
and endless inclines, and never was I disappointed; the
dark sentinels never called me in vain. The most lovely
little buildings have I discovered in these far-away
places.</p>

<p>Some were all of wood, warm in colour, like newly
baked brown bread, their enormous roofs giving them
the appearance of giant mushrooms growing in fertile
ground.</p>

<p>There is generally a belfry on the top, but with some
the belfry stands by itself in front of the church, and
is mostly deliciously quaint of shape.</p>

<p>Indescribable is the colour the old wood takes on.
It is always in harmony with its background, with its
surroundings; be it on a green meadow, or against dark
pines, be it in spring-time half concealed behind apple-trees
in full bloom, be it in autumn when the trees that
enclose it are all golden and russet and red.</p>

<p>The wood is dark-brown, with grey lights that are sometimes
silver. Green moss often pads the chinks between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the beams, giving the whole a soft velvety appearance
that satisfies the eye.</p>

<p>Within, these rustic sanctuaries are toy copies of larger
models; everything is tiny, but disposed in the same way.
In orthodox churches the altar is shut off from the rest
of the building by a carved and painted screen that nearly
touches the roof, and is generally crowned by an enormous
cross. At the lower part of these separations are the
pictures of the most venerated saints. There are three
small doors in these screens; during part of the service
these doors remain closed.</p>

<p>Women have no right to penetrate within the Holy
of Holies behind the screen.</p>

<p>Beautiful icons have I sometimes found in these forsaken
little churches, carried there no doubt from greater
ones when so-called improvements banished from their
renovated walls the old-time treasures forthwith considered
too shabby or too defaced.</p>

<p>Well do I remember one evening, after having climbed
an endless way, I came at last to the foot of the pine-trees
that had beckoned to me from afar, and how I reached
the open door of the sanctuary at the very moment when
the sun was going down.</p>

<p>The day had been wet, but this last hour before dusk
was trying by its beauty to make up for earlier frowns.</p>

<p>The villagers, having guessed my intentions, had sent
an old peasant to open the church. As I approached, the
sound of a bell reached me, tolling its greeting into the
evening air.</p>

<p><span class="vh"><a name="ill042a" id="ill042a">42A</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The last rays of the sun were lying golden on the
building as I reached the door. Like dancing flames
they had penetrated inside, spreading their glorious light
over the humble interior, surrounding the saints' painted
effigies with luminous haloes.</p>

<p>It was a wondrous sight!</p>

<p>On the threshold stood an old peasant, all in white,
his hands full of flowering cherry-branches, which he
offered me as he bent down to kiss the hem of my
gown.</p>

<p>Within, the old man's loving fingers had lit many
lights, and the same blossoms had been piously laid around
the holiest of the icons, the one that each believer must
kiss on entering the church.</p>

<p>The sunlight outshone the little tapers, but they seemed
to promise to continue its glory to the best of their ability
when the great parent should have gone to rest.... Sitting
down in a shadowy corner, I let the marvellous peace
of the place penetrate my soul, let the charm of this holy
house envelop me like a veil of rest.</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared; now the little lights stood
out, sharp points of brightness against the invading dusk.</p>

<p>Hard it was indeed to tear myself away; but time,
being no respecter of human emotions, moves on!</p>

<p>Outside the door an enormous stone cross stood like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a ghost, its head lost amongst the snowy branches of a
tree in full bloom. This cross was almost as high as the
church....</p>

<p>Varied indeed are the shapes of these peasant churches.
When they are not of wood, like those I have just described,
they are mostly whitewashed, their principal feature
being the stout columns that support the porch in front.
There is hardly a Rumanian church without this front
porch; it gives character to the whole; it is the principal
source of decoration. Sometimes the columns have beautiful
carved capitals of rarest design; sometimes they are
but solid pillars, whitewashed like the rest of the church.</p>

<p>Quaint indeed are the buildings that some simple-hearted
artist has painted all over with emaciated, brightly
robed saints. I have seen the strangest decorations of
this sort: whole processions of archaic figures in stiff
attitudes illustrating events out of their holy lives. Then
the front columns are also painted, often with quite lovely
designs, closely resembling Persian patterns in old blues
and reds and browns.</p>

<p>The roofs are always of shingle, with broad advancing
eaves of most characteristic shape.</p>

<p>A church have I seen in the middle of a maize field.
The roof had fallen in, the walls were cracked, in places
crumbling away, tall sunflowers peeped in at its paneless
windows, and the birds built their nests amongst the
beams of its ruined vaults. Pitiable it was, indeed, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
contemplate such desolation; yet never had I seen a more
magical sight.</p>

<p>The walls were still covered with frescoes, the colours
almost unspoilt; the richly carved altar-screen still showed
signs of gilding; hardly defaced were its many little
pictures of saints. The stalwart pillars separating one
part from the other stood strong and untouched except
that in parts their plaster coating had crumbled away.</p>

<p>Quite unique was the charm of that ruin. The blue
sky above was its roof, and the solemn saints stared down
from the walls as if demanding why no kindly hand was
raised to protect their fragile beauty from storm and
rain.</p>

<p>I know not why such a treasure was allowed to fall to
pieces&mdash;perchance there is no time to look after old ruins
in a country where so much has still to be done! Indeed,
the church was rarely fascinating, thus exposed to the
light of the day, yet distressing was the thought that, if
not soon covered in, the lovely frescoes would entirely
fall away.</p>

<p>There was a figure of the Holy Virgin that especially
attracted my attention; she stared at me from her golden
background with large, pathetic eyes. Upon her knees
the Child Christ sat, stiffly upright, one hand raised in
blessing; the child was tiny, with a strange pale countenance
and eyes much too large for its face.</p>

<p>I could not tear myself away from this forsaken place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of prayer; again and again I made the round of it, absorbing
into my soul the picture it made.</p>

<p>At last I left it, but many times did I turn round to
have a last look.</p>

<p>The sunflowers stood in tall groups, their heads bent
towards the church as though trying to look inside; a
flight of snow-white doves circled about it, their spotless
wings flashing in the light. It was the last I saw of it&mdash;the
ruined walls, and, floating above them, those snow-white
doves.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>Much more would I delight to relate about these little
churches. For me the topic is full of unending charm;
but there are many things that I must still talk about,
so regretfully I turn away to other scenes.</p>

<p>The most lonely inhabitants of Rumania are the
shepherds&mdash;more lonely even than the monks in their
cells, for the monks are gathered together in congregations,
whilst the shepherds spend whole months alone with their
dogs upon desolate mountain-tops.</p>

<p>Often when roaming on horseback on the summits
have I come upon these silent watchers leaning on their
staffs, standing so still that they might have been figures
carved out of stone.</p>

<p class="p1">The great blue sky was theirs, and the marvellous view
over limitless horizons; theirs were the shifting clouds,
floating sometimes above their heads, sometimes rising
like steam out of the chasms at their feet; theirs were
also the silence and the sunsets, the sunrise and the little
mountain flowers with their marvellous tints. But also
the storm was theirs, and the rain, and the days of impenetrable
mist; theirs was the wordless solitude unrelieved
by human voice.</p>

<p>These lonely mountain-dwellers become almost one
in colour with the rocks and earth by which they are
surrounded.</p>

<p>Enormous mantles do they wear, made of skins taken
from sheep of their flock, fallen by the way. These shaggy
garments give them a wild appearance resembling nothing
I have ever seen; even tiny boys wear these extraordinary
coats that cover them from head to foot, sheltering them
from rain and storm, and even from the too ardent rays
of the sun. Their only refuges are dug-outs, half beneath
the earth, of which the roofs are covered with turf, so that
even at a short distance they can hardly be seen. Here,
in company with their dogs, they spend the long summer
months, till the frosts of autumn send them and their
flocks back to the plains.</p>

<p>Fierce-looking creatures are these shepherds, almost
as unkempt as their dogs. Solitude seems to have crept
into their eyes, that look at you without sympathy, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
though they had lost the habit of focusing them to the
faces of men.</p>

<p>A sore danger to the wanderer are those savage dogs,
and often will their masters look on at the attacks they
make upon the unfortunate intruder, without moving a
finger in his defence.</p>

<p>No doubt sometimes a poet's soul is to be found amongst
these highland-watchers. He will then tell tales worth
listening to, for Nature will have been his teacher, the
voices of the wilds have entered his heart.</p>

<p>Less unsociable is the shepherd tending his flock in
greener pastures. He is less lonely; even when not living
with a companion he receives the visits of passers-by&mdash;his
expression is less grim, his eyes less hard, and the tunes
he plays on his flute have a softer note.</p>

<p>Here the great-coat is discarded, but the "cioban's"
attitude is always the same: be he on bare mountain pinnacles,
or on juicy pastures near clear-flowing stream, or
on the burning plains of the Dobrudja where for miles
around no tree is to be seen, the "cioban" stands, for
hours at a time, both hands under his chin, leaning on his
staff. He keeps no record of time; he stares before him,
and slowly the hours pass over his head.</p>

<p>Once I had a curious impression. I was riding over
some endless downs near the sea. Nothing could be flatter
than the landscape that stretched before me; the sea was
a dead calm, resembling a mirror of spangled blue; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sand was white and dazzling; waves of heat rose from
the ground, scorching my face; the entire world seemed to
be gasping for breath. I alone was moving upon this
immensity; sky, sea, and sand belonged to me.</p>

<p>In spite of the suffocating temperature, my horse was
galloping briskly, happy to feel the soft sand beneath
his hoofs. I had the sensation of moving through the
desert.</p>

<p>All at once the animal became restive; he snorted
through dilated nostrils, I felt him tremble beneath me;
sweat broke out all over his body; suddenly he stopped
short, and, swerving round unexpectedly, refused to advance!
Nothing was to be seen but a series of flat, curving
sand-hills, with here and there a tuft of hard grass, or
sprays of sea-lavender, bending beneath the overpowering
heat, yet I also had an uncanny sensation, the curious
feeling that something was breathing, as though the ground
itself were throbbing beneath our feet. In a way I shared
my horse's apprehension. What could it be?</p>

<p>In spite of his reluctance, I pushed him forward, keeping
a firm grip on the reins, as at each moment he tried to
swing round.</p>

<p>Then I saw something strange appear on the horizon;
a mysterious line undulating across one of the mounds,
something that was alive. I had the keen perception
that it was breathing, that it was even gasping for
breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once a man rose from somewhere and stood, a
dark splotch, against the brooding heat of the sky. The
man was a shepherd! Then I understood the meaning
of that weirdly palpitating line&mdash;it was his flock of
sheep!</p>

<p>Stifled by the overwhelming temperature, they had
massed themselves together, heads turned inwards, seeking
shelter one from the other. Finding no relief, they
were panting out their silent distress.</p>

<p>The "cioban" stood quite still, staring at me with
stupefied indifference.</p>

<p>I think that never before and never since have I had
an acuter sensation of intolerable heat....</p>

<p>Wherever I have met them, be it on the mountains
or in the plains, on green pastures or on arid wastes, these
silent shepherds have seemed to me the very personification
of solitude, of mystery, of things unsaid.</p>

<p>Because of their lonely vigils amongst voiceless wilds,
they have surely returned to a nearer comprehension
of nature; perchance they have discovered strange secrets
that none of us know!</p>

<p>In autumn and early spring the shepherds lead their
flocks back from the mountains. One meets them trudging
slowly along the high-roads&mdash;a silent mass with a weather-beaten
leader at their head, man and beast the colour
of dust; foot-sore, weary, passive, knowing that their
way is not yet at an end.</p>

<p class="p1">Fleeting visions of the wilds, wraiths come back from
solitudes of which we know naught. The men with
brooding faces and far-seeing eyes, the animals with
hanging heads, come towards one out of the distance,
pass, move away, and are gone ... leaving behind them
on the road thousands and thousands of tiny traces that
wind or rain soon efface....</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>There is a wandering people known in every land&mdash;a
people surrounded by mystery, whose origin has never
been clearly established, a people that even in our days
are nomads, moving, always moving from place to place.
Wherever they stray, the gipsies are looked upon with
mistrust and suspicion; they are known to be thieves;
their dark faces and flashing teeth at once attract and
repel. There is a nameless charm about them, and
yet aliens they are wherever they go. Every man's hand
is against them; nowhere are they welcome, ever must
they move on and on homeless, despised, and restless,
wanderers indeed on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Yet there are places in Rumania where those gipsies
have settled down on the outskirts of villages or towns.</p>

<p>There, in the midst of indescribable filth and disorder,
they are massed together in tumble-down huts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
dug-outs, half-naked, surrounded by squabbling children
and savage dogs. Their hovels are covered with whatever
they can lay hand upon: old tins, broken boards,
rags, clods of earth, torn strips of carpets; no words
can render the squalor that surrounds them, the abject
misery in which they swarm.</p>

<p>I have never been able to discover if always the same
gipsies live in these places, or if, after a time, they move
on, leaving their nameless hovels to other wanderers,
who for a time settle down and then depart, making place
for those who still will come.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that in some cases these settlements
are refuges where the wandering hordes seek shelter
in winter, when snow-drifts and bitter frosts make the
high-roads impracticable. Yet also in summer have I
seen families grovelling about in these sordid suburbs.</p>

<p>Infinitely more picturesque are the gipsy-camps. These
strange people will pitch their tents in all sorts of places.
On large fields used for pasture, on the edge of streams,
sometimes on islands in the midst of river-beds, or on
the border of woods.</p>

<p>Along the road they come, not in covered vans as
we see them in tamer countries, but in dilapidated carts,
drawn by lean, half-starved horses, sometimes by mules
or patient grey donkeys.</p>

<p>On these carts, amidst an indescribable jumble of poles,
carpets, tent-covers, pots, pans, and other implements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
whole families find place&mdash;mothers and children, old
grannies and greybeards, little boys and bigger youths,
regardless of the unfortunate animals that half succumb
beneath the burden.</p>

<p>They stop where they can, sometimes where they
must&mdash;for many places are prohibited, and no one desires
to have the thieving rascals too near their home.</p>

<p>To me these camps have always been an unending
source of interest. Whenever, from afar, I have perceived
the silhouettes of gipsy-tents, I have never failed to go
there, and no end of impressions have I gathered amongst
these wandering aliens. Often have I watched the carts
being unloaded; with much noise and strife the tent-poles
are fixed in the ground, discoloured rags of every
description are spread over them, each family erecting
the roof beneath which it will shelter for awhile its eternal
unrest.</p>

<p>Many and many a time have I roamed about amidst
the tents of these jabbering, squabbling hordes of beggars,
beset by hundreds of brown hands asking for pennies,
surrounded by dark faces with brilliant eyes and snow-white
teeth. Half cringing, half haughty, they would
demand money, laughing the while and shrugging their
shoulders, fingering my clothes, slipping their fingers into
my pockets; sometimes I have almost had the sensation
of being assailed by a troop of apes.</p>

<p>When on horseback they have nearly pulled me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the saddle, overwhelming me with strange blessings that
often sounded more like curses or imprecations.</p>

<p>But one wish that they cried after me was always
gratefully accepted by my heart; it was the wish of "Good
luck" to my horse. Being nomads, they appreciate the
value of a good mount, and as from all time my horse
has been my friend, such an invocation could not leave
me unmoved; on those days, the pennies I scattered
amongst them were given with a readier hand.</p>

<p>The most beautiful types have I discovered amongst
these people; at all ages they are inconceivably picturesque,
so much so indeed that occasionally they seemed to have
got themselves up with a view to effect.</p>

<p>Old hags have I seen crouching beneath their tents,
bending over steaming pots, stirring mysterious messes
with pieces of broken sticks. No old witch out of
Andersen's fairy-tales or the "Arabian Nights" could
be compared to these weird old beings draped in faded
rags that once had been bright, but that now were as
sordid and ancient as the old creatures they only half
clothed.</p>

<p>Gaudy bands of stuff were wound turban-wise round
their heads, from beneath which strands of grey hair
hung in dishevelled disorder over their eyes. Generally
a white-clay pipe was stuck in the corner of their mouths,
for both the men and women smoke; in fact, smoke
pervades the atmosphere about them, fumes of tobacco
mixing with the more pungent smell of the fires lighted
all over the camp.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="p1">These old crones are the respected members of the
tribes. Their loud curses call order to the young ones,
throw a certain awe amongst the rowdy quarrelling
children, who run about almost naked clamouring for
alms, turning summersaults in the dust, tumbling about
between one's feet. A sore trial to one's patience are
these scamps, but at the same time a source of infinite
delight to the eye, for extraordinarily beautiful are some
of these grinning, screeching little savages, one with the
colour of the earth; small bronze statues with curly,
tousled heads, large eyes bordered by indescribable lashes,
sometimes so long and curling that they appear to be
black feathers at their lids.</p>

<p>Occasionally a torn shirt barely covers them, or their
arms have been thrust into coats much too large, the
sleeves dangling limply over their hands, giving them
the appearance of small scarecrows come to life. Never
more enchanting are they than when gambolling about
as God made them, for all attire a string of bright beads
round their necks!</p>

<p>These earth-coloured little waifs will run for miles
beside one's carriage or horse, begging for coins with
extended palms, whining over and over again the same
complaint.</p>

<p>Most beautiful of all are the young girls: upright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
well grown, with narrow hips and delicate hands and
feet. Whatever rag they twist about their graceful limbs
turns into a becoming apparel. They will deck themselves
with any discarded finery they may pick up by
the way. Sometimes valuable old pieces of embroidery
will end their days upon the bodies of these attractive
creatures, enhancing their charm, giving them the air
of beggared queens. Bright girdles wound round hips
and waist keep all these rags in place, giving the wearer
the look of Egyptians such as we see painted on the frescoes
of temple-walls.</p>

<p>Beneath the gaudy scarves which they tie on their
heads plaits of hair hang down on both sides of their faces&mdash;plaits
that are decorated with every sort of coin, with
little splinters of coloured glass or metal, or strange-shaped
charms or holy medals that jingle as they move about.
Round their necks hang long strings of gaudy beads that
shine and glisten on their bronze-tinted skins.</p>

<p>Little modesty do these maidens show. They are
loud and forward, shameless beggars, quite indifferent
if their torn shirts leave neck and bosom half naked to
the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>With flashing white teeth they will smile at you, arms
akimbo, head thrown back, a white pipe impudently
stuck at the corner of their mouths.</p>

<p>Indescribably graceful are these girls coming back
to the camp at evening, carrying large wooden water-pots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
on their heads. Over the distance they advance, upright,
with swinging stride, whilst the water splashes in large
drops over their cheeks. The sinking sun behind them
gives them the appearance of shadows coming from very
far out of the desert where the paths have neither beginning
nor end....</p>

<p>The men are no less picturesque than the women;
they are covered with filthy rags, and are mostly barefooted.
But tribes have I encountered less sordid, where
the men wore high boots, baggy trousers, and shirts with
wide-hanging sleeves. These belonged to more prosperous
clans, the men particularly good-looking, with
long curling hair hanging on both sides of their faces.
Evil-looking creatures no doubt, but uncannily handsome
nevertheless.</p>

<p>Most gipsies are tinkers by profession, by instinct
they are thieves. Leaving their women-folk to look after
the tents, the men will set out towards the villages, there
to patch up pots and pans; often one meets them several
in file carrying bright copper vessels on their backs.
They grin at you, and never forget to stretch out a begging
hand.</p>

<p>Others have studied the gipsies' habits, morals, and
ways; I have only looked upon them with an artist's eye,
and in that way they are an unending source of joy.</p>

<p>Inconceivable is the bustle and noise when a camp
breaks up. The tent-poles are pulled out of the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the miserable horses that have been seeking scarce nourishment
from the withered wayside grass are caught by
the screeching children, who have easy work, as the unfortunate
creatures are hobbled and cannot escape. Resignedly
they let themselves be attached to the carts,
the tent-poles, carpets, pots and pans are once more
transferred from the ground to the vehicles that will
transport them to another place, and thus onwards ...
without end....</p>

<p>The old crones are stowed away beneath all this baggage,
and with them the children too small to walk, the
feeble old men, the invalids, and those too foot-sore to
tramp the weary way.</p>

<p>A delightful picture did I once perceive. Upon the
back of a patient donkey numerous tent-poles had been
tied; how so small a beast could carry them remains a
mystery. Between these poles several small naked babies
had been fastened, their black eyes staring at me from
beneath mops of tousled, unkempt curls.</p>

<p>The donkey moved from place to place, grazing, the
heavy poles bobbed about, one or the other touching
the ground, raising little clouds of dust like smoke.</p>

<p>No concern was to be read on the faces of the babies;
this mode of transport was no doubt the usual thing.
They looked like little brown monkeys brought from
warmer climes....</p>

<p class="p1">I have often met old couples wandering together&mdash;men
and women bent with age, weary, dusty, covered
with rags, with pipes in their mouths; wretched vagrants,
but always perfectly picturesque. No doubt they were
going to tinker in some villages, for the men carried on
their backs the inevitable copper pots, whilst the old hags
had heavy sacks slung over their shoulders, a thick staff
in their hands. Along the sides of their earth-coloured
checks grey plaits of hair hung limply down, swinging
as they went. It was to me as though I had often met
them before; I seemed to recognise their eyes, their weary
look, even the shell, sign of the fortune-teller, that the
women wore hanging from a string at their girdles; yet
no doubt they were but samples of the many wanderers
among this people who, homeless and foot-sore, are for
ever roaming over the earth....</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>One art above all others belongs to the gipsies. They
are born musicians, and the violin is their instrument;
even the smallest boy will be able to make it sing. Some
are musicians by profession. In groups of three and
four they will wander from village to village, always
where music is needed, patiently, tirelessly playing for
hours and hours, in sun or rain, night or day, at marriages,
funerals, or on feast-days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>When in bands these wandering minstrels have other
instruments besides violins. Strange-shaped lutes, well
known in Rumanian literature as the "cobsa," and a
flute composed of several reeds, the classical flute used
in ages past by old father Pan.</p>

<p>Mostly they are bronze-coloured old vagrants with
melancholy eyes and bent backs, who are accustomed
to cringe, and whose lean brown hands are accustomed
to beg. Discarding their picturesque rags, these wandering
minstrels have adopted hideous old clothes that others
have cast off. Infinitely more mean-looking are they in
this accoutrement; they have lost that indefinite charm
that generally surrounds them; they are naught but sad
old men clothed in ugly tatters, and are no more a delight
to the eyes. Welcome they are, nevertheless, for their
music is both sweet and melancholy, strident and weird;
there is a strange longing in every note, and the gayer
the tunes become the more is one inclined to weep!</p>

<p>An inexplicable cry of yearning lies in their every
melody&mdash;is it a remembrance of far-off lands that once
were theirs, and that they have never seen? Or is it
only an expression of the eternal nostalgia that drives
them restlessly from place to place?</p>

<p>One summer's evening I met a gipsy youth, coming
towards me from out of the dust of the road. Seated
with bare, dangling legs on the back of a donkey,
his violin under his chin, regardless of all else, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
playing ... playing to the sky above, to the stars that
were coming out one by one, peeping down with pale
wonder upon this lonely vagabond to whom all the road
belonged.... Playing because it was his nature to play
... playing to his heart that had not yet awakened ...
playing to his soul that he could not fathom.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>In towns the gipsies are used as masons. One finds
them in groups wherever a house is being built, men,
women, and children bringing with them their nameless
disorder and their picturesque filth.</p>

<p>Of an evening, the work being done, they will prepare
their supper, when, seated round the steaming pot, their
many-coloured rags become radiant beneath the rays of
the setting sun.</p>

<p>Often a mangy donkey is attached not far off, and in
a basket, amidst a medley of metal pots of all sizes and
shapes, lies a sleeping infant wrapped in a torn cloth.</p>

<p>The donkey patiently bears his burden, flicking away
the flies with his meagre tail.</p>

<p>In the month of lilies handsome gipsy-girls will wander
through the streets, carrying wooden vessels filled with
snow-white flowers, the purity of the lilies strangely in
contrast with their sun-tanned faces. In long, fragrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
bunches they sell these flowers to the passers-by. At
every corner one meets them, either crouching in picturesque
attitudes on the pavement or standing upright
beneath the shadowy angle of a roof, beautiful creatures
with dark faces readily breaking into smiles that make
their black eyes glisten and their white teeth flash.</p>

<p>Figures full of unconscious pride, visages at which
one must look and always look again ... for they contain
all the mystery of the many roads their feet have left
behind!</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>It is the season of harvest that shows Rumania in
all her glory, that season when the labour of man meets
its reward, when, the earth having given her utmost, man,
woman, and child go forth to gather in the wealth that
makes this country what it is.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, it is an hour of disappointment,
for rain, hail, or drought ofttimes undoes man's weary
work. Sometimes the earth has not responded to his
dearest hopes, has not been able to bring forth her
fruit.</p>

<p class="p1">Years have I known when, for months at a time, no
drop of rain has fallen, when, like the people of old, we
watched the sky in the ardent hope that the cloud as large
as a man's hand would spread and burst into the showerso sorely needed&mdash;but the cloud passed and gave not the
rain it promised; years when all that had been confided
to the bosom of the earth withered and dried away because
from April to September no drop had fallen, so that numbers
of wretched cattle died for want of pasturage upon which
to graze.</p>

<p>Terrible months of straining anxiety, of hopeless waiting
that seemed to dry up the blood in one's veins, as the
earth was parched from the want of rain.</p>

<p>The rivers had no more water; the land of plenty
becomes a land of sighs, the dust covering all things as
with a shroud of failure....</p>

<p>But grand indeed are the years of plenty, when man's
effort bears fruit.</p>

<p>In oceans of ripe gold the corn lies beneath the
immense face of the sun, proud of its plenty, a glorious
hope fulfilled!</p>

<p>And, from that vast plain of fertility, man's hand it
is that reaps the ripe ears, that binds the sheaves, that
gathers in the grain. Ever again and again must I marvel
at the patience of man's labour, marvel at his extraordinary
conquest over the earth.</p>

<p>In groups the peasants work from early dawn to sunset,
unaffected by the pulsing heat beating down upon their
heads. The men's snowy shirts contrast with the women's
coloured aprons that stain the tawny plain with vivid
spots of blue, red, or orange, for at the season of harvest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
no one remains idle&mdash;the very old and the disabled alone
are left behind to guard the house.</p>

<p>From hour to hour ceaselessly they toil, till midday
gathers them round their carts for frugal repast of polenta
and onions. Pictures of labour, of healthy effort, of
simple content! How often have I contemplated them
with emotion, realising how dear this country had grown
to my heart.</p>

<p>Watchful dogs guard the carts and those of the children
too small to work; beneath the shade of these vehicles
the labourers take a short hour's rest, alongside of their
grey bullocks that in placid content lie chewing the cud,
their enormous horns sending back the rays of the sun.
Lazily they swish their tails from side to side, keeping
off the too busy flies that gather on their lean flanks and
round their large, dreamy eyes. With slow turns of their
heads they follow their masters' movements, well aware
that their own effort must be taken up again at the
hour of sunset when the labourers go home.</p>

<p>Only on rich estates is machinery used, and then mostly
for threshing the corn; nearly all the cutting is done by
hand. Small gatherings of busy labourers crowd around
the iron monster, whose humming voice can be heard
from afar, and always rises the heap of grain till it
stands, a burnished pyramid of gold, beneath the great
blue sky.</p>

<p>At sunset the peasants return home, their scythes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
over their shoulders, walking beside their carts heaped
up with bright yellow straw. Along the road they crawl,
those carts, in a haze of dust. On wind-still evenings
the dust remains suspended in the air, covering the world
with a silvery gauze, enveloping the dying day in a
haze of mystery that floats over man and beast, wiping
out the horizon, toning down all colours, softening every
outline.</p>

<p>Often the sinking sun sets this haze aflame; then
the atmosphere becomes strangely luminous, as though
a tremendous fire were burning somewhere behind fumes
of smoke. Indescribable is that hour; full of beauty,
full of peace, full of the infinite satisfaction of work faithfully
accomplished, the hour when all feet are turned
homewards, turned towards rest.</p>

<p>In never-ending file the carts follow each other, drawn
by those grey-white oxen with the wondrous horns&mdash;along
the road they come as though moving in a dream,
that slowly passes in a cloud of dust and is gone; ... but
the dust remains suspended like a veil drawn over a vision
that is no more....</p>

<p>The maize-harvest comes later in the year, much
later; sometimes in October the peasants are still gathering
the ripe fruit. The days are short, and in the evening
dampness rises out of the vast plain, and hovers like smoke
beneath the glowing sky. An indescribable melancholy
floats over the world, the melancholy of things come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
an end. A great effort seems completed, and now the
year has no more to do but to fall slowly to sleep....
Yet nothing is more glorious than the Rumanian
autumn; Nature desires to deck herself in a last mantle
of beauty before confessing herself vanquished by the
advancing of the winter season.</p>

<p>The sky becomes intensely blue; all that stands up
against it appears to acquire a new value. The trees
dress themselves in wondrous colours, sometimes golden,
sometimes russet, sometimes flaming red. Amongst the
man-high maize-plants, giant sunflowers stand bending
their heads, heavy with the weight of the seeded centres;
like prodigious stars their saffron petals shine against
the azure vault.</p>

<p>Whole fields have I seen of these giant plants, real
armies of sun-shaped flowers, triumphantly yellow beneath
the rays of the great light they so bravely mimic. But
often it seems to me that ashamedly they turn their faces
away, sadly aware that they are but a sorry imitation
of the one whose name they bear. Oil is made out of
the seeds of these flowers; therefore do the peasants
cultivate them in such numbers.</p>

<p>Often beneath the shade of those giant plants have
I seen peasants seated in circles round piles of maize,
separating the fruit from the leaves. In dwarf pyramids
of orange, the ripe cobs lie scattered about the wilting
fields, their glorious colour attracting the eye from
afar; often the women's kerchiefs are of the very same
tint.</p>

<p class="p1">I love these flaming touches of colour amongst the
arid immensities of reaped fields&mdash;lovingly the eye of
the artist lingers to look at them, only unwillingly turning
away.</p>

<p>A pretty sight is also that of the peasant meetings,
either in large barns or courtyards, to unsheathe the grain
of maize from its cob. These are occasions of great rejoicing,
when the young folk flock together, when laughter and
work mingle joyously, when long yarns are told and love-songs
are sung. The old crones sit around spinning or
weaving, their heads nodding together over delectable
gossip, one eye upon the youths and maidens, who,
dressed in their brightest, with a flaring flower stuck
behind the ear, ogle each other, and joke and kiss and
are happy.</p>

<p>The old gipsy "Lautar," or wander-minstrel, is never
absent from these meetings. From somewhere he is sure
to come limping along, shabby, disreputable, a sordid
figure with his violin or his "cobsa" under his arm;
but his music is wonderful, making all hearts laugh, or
dance, or weep.</p>

<p class="pn center mid p1 b1">*<br />*<span class="vh">&mdash;</span>*</p>

<p>Too many pictures would I evoke, too many visions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
rise before my brain&mdash;both time and talent fail me&mdash;so
grudgingly must I turn away and leave these simple
people to their work and their play, to their joys and
their pains, their hopes and their fears. I leave them to
their peaceful homes&mdash;a veil of dust lying over.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
